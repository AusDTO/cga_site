title: Why we built it

<p class="abstract">We believe digital teams should be able to host their applications without having to worry about the complexity of setting up and managing cloud infrastructure.</p>

At the start of 2016 the Digital Transformation Agency had many digital teams starting new projects. Some of these new projects included government teams from outside the DTA which were part of the Exemplar program.

We decided to build cloud.gov.au for four reasons:

1. We wanted our teams to focus all their efforts on building their application, not building infrastructure
2. We wanted to give our teams the power to rapidly deploy and manage their own applications. This means we remove WebOps as a bottleneck for teams getting stuff done.
3. We wanted to standardise each teams infrastructure. This meant we could more efficiently manage and scale infrastructure across many projects
4. We wanted to make sure our teams could update, manage and deploy their applications at the same pace as their sprint cycles
