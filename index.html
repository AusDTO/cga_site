<h2>Build apps not infrastrucutre</h2>

We believe digital teams should be able to focus on building applications that
meet user needs without having to worry about the complexity of setting up and
managing cloud infrastructure.


cloud.gov.au makes it easy for teams to quickly deploy, manage and scale their
own application without needing WebOps experience.
