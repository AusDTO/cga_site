<p>cloud.gov.au is a Platform as a Service that makes it easy for teams to deploy
their applications to the cloud.</p>

<h2>Why we built it</h2>

<p>We built cloud.gov.au to help government digital teams deliver products when working agile and trying to meet the Digital Service Standard.</p>

<h3>Build apps not infrastrucutre</h3>

<p>We beleve digital teams should focus on building great public services, not managing cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>cloud.gov.au makes it easy for small digital teams to quickly deploy, manage and scale their
own applications.</p>

<h3>Meet user needs quickly</h3>

<p>We know that to understand and meet user needs, teams need to be
able to put updates, bug fixes and new features in the hands of users as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>cloud.gov.au makes deployment safe and easy, so teams can deploy updates to
their applications in a matter of minutes.</p>

<h3>Built for agile teams</h3>

<p>We built cloud.gov.au with agile teams in mind.
As agile practices become more common in Government, decision making and
responsibility is being pushed down to the delivery team level. It is critical
that we enable small teams to manage their own deployment and not rely on
slow enterprise deployment process which can take weeks or months to deploy changes.</p>

technology Cloud Foundry, running on top of Amazon Web Services in the Sydney region.</p>

<p>To help teams release changes faster and more safely, all changes to production
are done through a fully automated Continuous Delivery pipeline:</p>
